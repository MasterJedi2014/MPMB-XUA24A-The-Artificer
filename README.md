# MPMB XUA24A "The Artificer"
This script adds the Artificer & its subclasses from the 2024 *Unearthed Arcana: The Artificer* article.

**This script is to be used in conjunction with the 5.24E scripts by ThePokésimmer. It will not work properly without those installed first. You can find those scripts here: https://github.com/thepokesimmer/2024-PHB/tree/main**

**Script Credit Note:**
This file has been compiled by MasterJedi2014, though the bones of the script are based on the code from MPMB and those who have contributed to the sheet's existing material in the "all_WotC_pub+UA" script. The only things in this script that I can currently take credit for are:
- Alterations made to address changes made by the UA;
- Converting the Homunculus Servant infusion into a spell, along with the needed `CompanionList` & `CreatureList` entries.
I am also using code within the script written by the users Shroo, ThePokésimmer, & TrackAtNite.

This script will allow users to more easily playtest the revised Artificer. It also includes options to re-enable some aspects of the 2019/2020 Artificer that might be needed for an existing character to function.

**Script Patch Notes:**
- **2024-05-25:**
  - Initial upload of script.

**Known Bugs:**
- No known bugs at this time. Will update when any are found.
